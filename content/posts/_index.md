I am Richard Marles", img = "https://cdn.marlescodesolutions.com/IMG-20170923-WA0003.jpg", text = "Walter is kind, caring and timid, but also demanding, calculating, and ruthless. His invented pseudonym, Heisenberg, becomes an alter ego â€“ a fantasy for him to live out a love of power. Beneath both sides of his dual personality, he views the world in the rarefied scientific terms of chemistry."}
